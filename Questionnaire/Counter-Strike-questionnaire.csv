There are some people who are really good at hiding their cheaths. Generally these players are good enough at the game and can perform well enough without cheating. In these cases I think you have to look for skill gaps or the timing factor. I argue that is really difficult to have the perfect timing to peek or to flank throughout a whole CS game. For example, if someone repeatedly peeks the second that an AWP turns away from the line, I would generally assume that the person is cheating if I was unsure about it beforehand",Good luck with the Thesis!

Then, I check their profile, stats, and history. Based on that, I decide how closely I’ll need to watch their gameplay. For example, someone with thousands of hours in their history and consistent performance is probably not a cheater, and if I don’t see anything particularly suspicious in their gameplay, I’ll quickly rule them out.

On the other hand, if it’s a new account—or an old account with many hours but a sudden spike in performance—then I’ll be more suspicious and examine the video much more thoroughly.

Next, I watch the video. There’s a set of skills a player can have:
Crosshair placement, recoil control, movement tracking, flicking when it comes to aiming.
Also, movement in general, game sense, and how they clear angles.
If a player is extremely good at one of these skills but noticeably lacking in the others, I’ll suspect they’re cheating and will look for concrete evidence.
That imbalance between skills isn't proof by itself, but it’s a strong indicator that makes me investigate further.

Concrete signs that someone is cheating include:

They don’t check any other angles except the exact one where the enemy is—repeatedly, not just once.

They’re never surprised by an enemy’s position.

They shoot at enemies faster than what would be possible with normal human reflexes (prefiring).
These are signs of a wallhack.

Their bullets constantly hit the target even when their aim is off and their crosshair placement isn’t right.
That’s a sign of an aimbot.",

Why do cheaters exist in CS2? Many reasons. With counter strike being a relatively simple game, it has a high skill ceiling which might frustrate some players. They may start cheating in order to boost their ego, seek appraisal from others. They may not having the mentality to improve at the game, looking for quick and easy way to feel better about themselves. Also, I believe some  simply want to grind xp for weekly drops the easy way.
Why is this problematic for us, legit players? Well, we want to be matched against players with similar skill sets, who share our competitive spirit and genuinely want to improve at the game.
Why am I convinced cheaters exist in CS (or any competitive games for that matter)? Well, there are many cheaters who do it in a very obvious, even obnoxious way. If you play the game and/or watch the pro scene, you can clearly see the pattern of a clean l, genuine gameplay. On the other hand, there are plenty of closeted cheaters who have mastered hiding the fact that they use ""help"". There are many cheaters who also brag about using cheats and even compete with other cheaters (""who has the better cheat"").
From the more technical perspective, i think it's just very difficult to detect cheaters. I don't know that much about cheat development, but it's clear as a day that cheat devs adjust their ""products"" very quickly if, for example, VAC starts detecting it. They find new ways to avoid detection. Many claim that a kernel anti-cheatwould fix the problem, but we have evidence that even such, controversial for many, solution is still fairly easy to bypass (cheating is still a problem on faceit, PUBG also suffers from it as far as I know, etc)",,"No, I did not have access to overwatch, but i have reviewed my own demos",,,,"Predictive playstyle;Unnatural crossair movement;Unnatural movement (bunny hopping, spinbotting, etc.);Skill gaps in different areas of play (aim, movement, awareness, timings, etc.)","I'm trying not to jump into conclusions straight away and give them the benefit of the doubt, so unless it's very obvious like spinbotting, shooting through the walls, soft aim (if the player is not being careful with it), I try not to call them out or report them.
However, apart from demos, there's also the social perspective of cheating - steam accounts. If an account looks fairly new or is private, it is already making it more suspicious. But on the other hand, does it really matter nowadays when you can buy a legit looking account for a few bucks? ",Good luck!

Its usually not one thing, but combination of a lot of stuff. Things like 28k elo, no faceit, under 1000 hours on account, bot movement, crosshair placement all over the place and so on.
